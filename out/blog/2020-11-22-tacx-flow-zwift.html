which was great fun whilst the weather was nice and exercise time was limited.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/turbo-trainer-garden.jpg" alt="B&#x27;Twin bike on a TacX turbo trainer"></p>
<p>It's a bit harder to cycle during the evenings now the days are shorter, so I was
quite keen to give the virtual training app <a href="https://zwift.com/uk">Zwift</a> a go.
Unfortunately my trainer (TacX Flow Multiplayer T1901) doesn't support any
"smart" capabilities, but it does output data to a head unit so I wondered
whether it was possible to grab this on my computer and relay to Zwift from there.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/tacx-flow.jpeg" alt="TacX Flow Turbo Trainer"></p>
<p>Fortunately I found a project on GitHub that has an <a href="https://github.com/totalreverse/ttyT1941/wiki">extremely thorough breakdown
of TacX hardware</a> and some code
that controls the motor brake. I stripped the end off an RJ12 cable, added some
DuPont connectors and plugged it into a cheap <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001510943320.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.55d566a0yMqaav&#x26;algo_pvid=269039b5-5cbd-4e5e-adf2-f222049e69b5&#x26;algo_expid=269039b5-5cbd-4e5e-adf2-f222049e69b5-0&#x26;btsid=2100bdd816061658116438940ef458&#x26;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_">CP2102 6 in 1 USB to serial converter</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/cp2102.jpeg" alt="CP2102 serial converter"></p>
<p>I had to hunt the internet a bit to find out what to set the dip switches to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/cp2102-dip-switch.jpg" alt="CP2102 dip switch chart"></p>
<p>No additional drivers needed on Ubuntu 20, plug it in and you can see the kernel
module loaded.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/cp2102-lsmod.png" alt="lsmod showing cp210x driver loaded"></p>
<p>Everything was looking good, so I ran the python script included with ttyT1941
and I got... nothing. Uncommenting some lines in the source for some additional
debugging information didn't yield any further information.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/tty-fail.png" alt="Terminal showing errors"></p>
<p>After that I tried a few different tools (minicom, interceptty, screen) to see
if I could see any data at all coming directly from the device, but they all
were returning a blank. I re-tested the cable with a multimeter for connectivity,
and checked that there was some current on Tx and Rx pins. Unfortunately that
reaches the limit for what I'm able to test as I don't have access to an
oscilloscope.</p>
<p>Off to eBay where I was able to buy a cheap T1904 green head unit, which should
be capable of controlling the motor brake. This head unit has a USB-B output.</p>
